# Hangman Mini Project

Welcome to the Hangman Mini Project! This is a simple yet entertaining game implemented in Python. The objective of the game is to guess a word by guessing individual letters. Are you ready to challenge your word-guessing skills?

## Prerequisites

Before you can run this project, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Python: You can download and install Python from the official Python website: [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Pygame: Install the Pygame library by running the following command in your terminal:

```shell
pip install pygame
```

If you don't have Python or Pygame installed, don't worry! We've got you covered with easy installation instructions.

## Usage

To start the game, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```shell
python hangman.py
```

Once the game starts, you will be presented with a series of underscores representing the hidden word. Your task is to guess the letters one by one and fill in the blanks. Be careful though, as you only have a limited number of attempts before the hangman is complete!
